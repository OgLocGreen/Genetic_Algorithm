# Genetic Algorithm

This work was implemented as part of the bachelor thesis. 

The topic was: "Genetic Algorithms for the Optimization of Hyperparameters for Artificial Neural Networks".

The task was a comparison of Genetic Algorithms and Grid Search and Random Search was performed.

For the genetic algorithm no library was used. It was tested on various Artificial Neural Networks programmed in Python and Tensorflow.
